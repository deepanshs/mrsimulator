**OpenBLAS and FFTW libraries**

On Linux, the package manager for your distribution is usually the easiest route to
ensure you have the prerequisites to building the mrsimulator library. To build from
source, you will need the OpenBLAS and FFTW development headers for your Linux
distribution. Type the following command in the terminal, based on your Linux
distribution.

*For (Debian/Ubuntu):*

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev libfftw3-dev

*For (Fedora/RHEL):*

.. code-block:: bash

  $ sudo yum install openblas-devel fftw-devel

**Install a C/C++ compiler**

The C-compiler comes with your Linux distribution. No further action is
required.
