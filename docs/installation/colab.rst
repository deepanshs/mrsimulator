Colaboratory is a Google research project. It is a Jupyter Notebook environment
that runs entirely in the cloud. Launch a new notebook on
`Colab <https://colab.research.google.com>`_. We recommend going through
the *Welcome to Colab!* tutorial if you are new to Notebooks.

.. By default, Colaboratory has an older version of ``numpy`` installed, which
.. first needs to be updated. In a new cell, run
..
.. .. code-block:: shell
..
..     !pip install -U numpy
..
.. and press the *Restart Runtime* button

To install the **MRSimulator** package, type

.. code-block:: shell

    !pip install mrsimulator

in a new cell, execute, and finally restart the runtime.
All done! You may now start using the library or
proceed to :ref:`getting_started` to continue the tutorial.
