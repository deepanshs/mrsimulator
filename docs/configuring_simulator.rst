Up until now, we have been using the simulator object with the default setting.
In ``mrsimulator``, we choose the default settings such that it applies to a wide
range of simulations including, static, magic angle spinning (MAS), and
variable angle spinning (VAS) spectra. In certain situations, however, the
default settings are not sufficient to accurately represent the spectrum. In
such cases, the user is advised to modify these settings as required. In the
following section, we briefly describe the configuration settings.

The :ref:`simulator_api` class is configured using the
:attr:`~mrsimulator.Simulator.config` attribute. The default value
of the config attributes is as follows,

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> from mrsimulator import Simulator, SpinSystem, Site
    >>> from mrsimulator.methods import BlochDecaySpectrum
    ...
    >>> sim = Simulator()
    >>> sim.config
    ConfigSimulator(number_of_sidebands=64, integration_type='Alderman', integration_volume='octant', integration_density=70, decompose_spectrum='none')

Here, the configurable attributes are ``number_of_sidebands``, ``integration_type``,
``integration_volume``, ``integration_density``, and ``decompose_spectrum``.


Number of sidebands
-------------------
The value of this attribute is the number of sidebands requested in evaluating the
spectrum. The default value is 64 and is sufficient for most cases, as seen from our
previous examples. In certain circumstances, especially when the anisotropy is large
or the rotor spin frequency is low, 64 sidebands might not be sufficient. In such
cases, the user will need to increase the value of this attribute as required.
Conversely, 64 sidebands might be redundant for other problems, in which case the user
may want to reduce the value of this attribute. Note, reducing the number of sidebands
will significantly improve computation performance, which might save computation time
when used in iterative algorithms, such as least-squares minimization.

The following is an example of when the number of sidebands is insufficient.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> sim = Simulator()
    ...
    >>> # create a site with a large anisotropy, 100 ppm.
    >>> Si29site = Site(isotope='29Si', shielding_symmetric={'zeta': 100, 'eta': 0.2})
    ...
    >>> # create a method. Set a low rotor frequency, 200 Hz.
    >>> method = BlochDecaySpectrum(
    ...     channels=['29Si'],
    ...     rotor_frequency=200, # in Hz.
    ...     spectral_dimensions=[dict(count=1024, spectral_width=25000)]
    ... )
    ...
    >>> sim.spin_systems += [SpinSystem(sites=[Si29site])]
    >>> sim.methods += [method]
    ...
    >>> # simulate and plot
    >>> sim.run()
    >>> plot(sim.methods[0].simulation) # doctest: +SKIP

.. _fig1_config:
.. figure:: _static/null.*

    Inaccurate spinning sidebands simulation resulting from computing a relatively low
    number of sidebands.

If you are familiar with the NMR spinning sideband patterns, you may notice that the
sideband simulation spectrum in :numref:`fig1_config` is inaccurate, as evident from
the abrupt termination of the sideband amplitudes at the edges. As mentioned earlier,
this inaccuracy arises from evaluating a small number of sidebands relative to the
given anisotropy. Let's increase the number of sidebands to 90 and observe.
:numref:`fig2_config` depicts an accurate spinning sideband simulation.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # set the number of sidebands to 90.
    >>> sim.config.number_of_sidebands = 90
    >>> sim.run()
    >>> plot(sim.methods[0].simulation) # doctest: +SKIP

.. _fig2_config:
.. figure:: _static/null.*

    Accurate spinning sideband simulation when using a large number of sidebands.


Integration volume
------------------

The attribute `integration_volume` is an enumeration with two literals, ``octant`` and
``hemisphere``.
The integration volume refers to the volume of the sphere over which the NMR frequencies
are integrated. The default value is `octant`, i.e., the spectrum comprises of integrated
frequencies arising from the positive octant of the sphere.
The ``mrsimulator`` package enables the user to exploit the orientational symmetry of
the problem, and thus optimize the simulation by performing a partial integration
---`octant` or `hemisphere`. To learn more about the orientational symmetries,
please refer to Eden et. al. [#f4]_

.. In previous examples, we exploited the :math:`\text{D}_{2h}` symmetry
.. of the problem and therefore were able to simulate the spectrum by integrating
.. the line-shape over an octant. Observe what happens when this symmetry breaks.

Consider the :math:`^{29}\text{Si}` site, ``Si29site``, from the previous example. This
site has a symmetric shielding tensor with `zeta` and `eta` as 100 ppm and 0.2,
respectively. With only `zeta` and `eta`, we can exploit the symmetry of the problem,
and evaluate the frequency integral over the octant, which is equivalent to the
integration over the sphere. By adding the Euler angles to this tensor, we break the
symmetry, and the integration over the octant is no longer accurate.
Consider the following examples.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # add Euler angles to the shielding tensor.
    >>> Si29site.shielding_symmetric.alpha = 1.563 # in rad
    >>> Si29site.shielding_symmetric.beta = 1.2131 # in rad
    >>> Si29site.shielding_symmetric.gamma = 2.132 # in rad
    ...
    >>> # Let's observe the static spectrum which is more intuitive.
    >>> sim.methods[0] = BlochDecaySpectrum(
    ...     channels=['29Si'],
    ...     rotor_frequency=0, # in Hz.
    ...     spectral_dimensions=[dict(count=1024, spectral_width=25000)]
    ... )
    ...
    >>> # simulate and plot
    >>> sim.run()
    >>> plot(sim.methods[0].simulation) # doctest: +SKIP

.. _fig3_config:
.. figure:: _static/null.*

    An example of an incomplete spectral averaging, where the simulation comprises of
    frequency contributions evaluated over the positive octant.


The spectrum in :numref:`fig3_config` is incorrect. To fix this, set the integration
volume to `hemisphere` and re-simulate. :numref:`fig4_config` depicts the accurate
simulation of the CSA tensor.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # set integration volume to `hemisphere`.
    >>> sim.config.integration_volume = 'hemisphere'
    ...
    >>> # simulate and plot
    >>> sim.run()
    >>> plot(sim.methods[0].simulation) # doctest: +SKIP

.. _fig4_config:
.. figure:: _static/null.*

    The spectrum resulting from the frequency contributions evaluated over the top
    hemisphere.

Integration density
-------------------

Integration density controls the number of orientational points sampled over the given
volume. The resulting spectrum is an integration of the NMR resonance frequency
evaluated at these orientations. The total
number of orientations, :math:`\Theta_\text{count}`, is given as

.. math::
    \Theta_\text{count} = M (n + 1)(n + 2)/2,

where :math:`M` is the number of octants and :math:`n` is value of this attribute. The
number of octants is deciphered form the value of the `integration_volume` attribute.
The default value of this attribute, 70, produces 2556 orientations at which the NMR
frequency contribution is evaluated. The user may increase or decrease the value of
this attribute as required by the problem.

Consider the following example.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> sim = Simulator()
    >>> sim.config.integration_density
    70
    >>> sim.config.get_orientations_count() # 1 * 71 * 72 / 2
    2556
    >>> sim.config.integration_density = 100
    >>> sim.config.get_orientations_count() # 1 * 101 * 102 / 2
    5151


Decompose spectrum
------------------

.. todo::

    Add literal ``transition_pathway``.

The attribute `decompose_spectrum` is an enumeration with two literals, ``none``,
and ``spin_system``. The value of this attribute lets us know
how the user intends the simulation to be stored.

``none``
''''''''

If the value is ``none`` (default), the result of the simulation is a single spectrum
where the frequency contributions from all the spin systems are co-added. Consider the
following example.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # Create two sites
    >>> site_A = Site(isotope='1H', shielding_symmetric={'zeta': 5, 'eta': 0.1})
    >>> site_B = Site(isotope='1H', shielding_symmetric={'zeta': -2, 'eta': 0.83})
    ...
    >>> # Create two spin systems, each with single site.
    >>> system_A = SpinSystem(sites=[site_A], name='System-A')
    >>> system_B = SpinSystem(sites=[site_B], name='System-B')
    ...
    >>> # Create a method object.
    >>> method = BlochDecaySpectrum(
    ...     channels=['1H'],
    ...     spectral_dimensions=[dict(count=1024, spectral_width=10000)]
    ... )
    ...
    >>> # Create simulator object.
    >>> sim = Simulator()
    >>> sim.spin_systems += [system_A,  system_B] # add the spin systems
    >>> sim.methods += [method] # add the method
    ...
    >>> # simulate and plot.
    >>> sim.run()
    >>> plot(sim.methods[0].simulation) # doctest: +SKIP

.. _fig5_config:
.. figure:: _static/null.*

    The spectrum is an integration of the spectra from individual spin systems when the
    value of `decompose_spectrum` is ``none``.

:numref:`fig5_config` depicts the simulation of the spectrum from two spin systems
where the contributions from individual spin systems are co-added.

``spin_system``
'''''''''''''''

When the value of this attribute is ``spin_system``, the resulting simulation is a
series of spectra, each arising from a spin system. In this case, the number of
spectra is the same as the number of spin system objects.
Try setting the value of the decompose_spectrum attribute to `spin_system` and observe
the simulation.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # set decompose_spectrum to true.
    >>> sim.config.decompose_spectrum = "spin_system"
    ...
    >>> # simulate.
    >>> sim.run()
    ...
    >>> # plot of the two spectrum
    >>> plot(sim.methods[0].simulation) # doctest: +SKIP

.. figure:: _static/null.*

    Spectrum from individual spin systems when the value of the `decompose_spectrum`
    config is ``spin_system``.


.. Unlike the `spin_system`, where the user is aware of the number of spin systems within
.. the simulator object, the number of transition pathways may not always be intuitive.
.. Note, even a small spin system, depending on the NMR method, can generate a massive
.. number of transition pathways. When using this configuration, care must be taken, else
.. one could easily generate gigabytes of data, and run into a memory issue.
