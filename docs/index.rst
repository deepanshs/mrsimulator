Welcome to mrsimulator's documentation!
=======================================

The package ``mrsimulator`` contains key functionality and tools needed for
simulating one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lineshapes using
Python. The package is currently under development. Version 0.1.0 supports
simulation of single spin :math:`I=\frac{1}{2}` nuclei static,
magic angle spinning (MAS), and variable angle spinning (VSA) lineshapes.
