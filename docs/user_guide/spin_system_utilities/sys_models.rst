Spin System Models
==================

``mrsimulator`` includes the Czjzek and Extended Czjzek models for creating distributions of
tensor parameters. The method :meth:`~mrsimulator.collection.single_site_system_generator`
can be used with the Czjzek models to efficiently create spin systems modeling amorphous
materials.
