Signal Processing
=================

Introduction
------------

After running a simulation, you may need to apply some post-simulation signal processing.
For example, you may want to scale the intensities to match the experiment or convolve the
spectrum with a Lorentzian, Gaussian, or sinc line-broadening functions. There are many
signal-processing libraries, such as Numpy and Scipy, that you may use to accomplish this.
Although, in NMR, certain operations like convolutions, Fourier transform, and apodizations
are so regularly used that it soon becomes inconvenient to have to write your own set of
code. For this reason, the ``mrsimulator`` package offers some frequently used NMR signal
processing tools.

.. note::
    The simulation object in *mrsimulator* is a CSDM object. A CSDM object is the python
    support for the core scientific dataset model (CSDM) [#f1]_, which is a new open-source
    universal file format for multi-dimensional datasets. Since CSDM objects hold a generic
    multi-dimensional scientific dataset, the following signal processing operation can
    be applied to any CSDM dataset, *i.e.*, NMR, EPR, FTIR, GC, etc.


In the following section, we demonstrate the use of the
:class:`~mrsimulator.signal_processing.SignalProcessor` class in applying various operations
to a generic CSDM object. But before we start explaining signal processing with CSDM
objects, it seems necessary to first describe the construct of CSDM objects. Each CSDM object
has two main attributes, *dimensions* and *dependent_variables*. The *dimensions* attribute
holds a list of Dimension objects, which collectively form a multi-dimensional Cartesian
coordinates grid system. A Dimension object can represent both physical and non-physical
dimensions. The *dependent_variables* attribute holds the responses of the multi-dimensional
grid points. You may have as many dependent variables as you like, as long as all dependent
variables share the same coordinates grid, *i.e.*, dimensions.



``SignalProcessor`` class
-------------------------

Signal processing is a series of operations that are applied to the dataset. In this
workflow, the result from the previous operation becomes the input for the next
operation.

In the ``mrsimulator`` library, all signal processing operations are accessed through the
*signal_processing* module. Within the module is the *apodization* sub-module. An
apodization is a point-wise multiplication operation of the input signal with the
apodizing vector. See :ref:`operations_api` documentation for a complete list of
operations.

Import the module as

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> from mrsimulator import signal_processing as sp

Convolution
-----------

The convolution theorem states that under suitable conditions, the Fourier transform of a
convolution of two signals is the pointwise product (apodization) of their Fourier transforms.
In the following example, we employ this theorem to demonstrate how to apply a Gaussian
convoluting to a dataset.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> processor = sp.SignalProcessor(
    ...     operations=[
    ...         sp.IFFT(), sp.apodization.Gaussian(FWHM='0.1 km'), sp.FFT()
    ...     ]
    ... )

Here, the *processor* is an instance of the :class:`~mrsimulator.signal_processing.SignalProcessor`
class. The required attribute of this class, *operations*, is a list of operations. In the
above example, we employ the convolution theorem by sandwiching the Gaussian apodization
function between two Fourier transformations.

In this scheme, first, an inverse Fourier transform is applied to the datasets. On the
resulting dataset, a Gaussian apodization, equivalent to a full width at half maximum of
0.1 km in the reciprocal dimension, is applied. The unit that you use for the FWHM attribute
depends on the dimensionality of the dataset dimension. By choosing the unit as km, we imply
that the corresponding dimension of the CSDM object undergoing the above series of operations
has a dimensionality of length.
Finally, a forward Fourier transform is applied to the apodized dataset.

Let's create a CSDM object and then apply the above signal processing operations.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> import csdmpy as cp
    >>> import numpy as np
    ...
    >>> # Creating a test CSDM object.
    >>> test_data = np.zeros(500)
    >>> test_data[250] = 1
    >>> csdm_object = cp.CSDM(
    ...     dependent_variables=[cp.as_dependent_variable(test_data)],
    ...     dimensions=[cp.LinearDimension(count=500, increment='1 m')]
    ... )

.. note::
    See `csdmpy <https://csdmpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for a detailed description of
    generating CSDM objects. In ``mrsimulator``, the simulation data is already stored as a
    CSDM object.

To apply the previously defined signal processing operations to the above CSDM object, use
the :meth:`~mrsimulator.signal_processing.SignalProcessor.apply_operations` method of the
``SignalProcessor`` instance as follows,

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> processed_data = processor.apply_operations(data=csdm_object)

The *data* is the required argument of the *apply_operations* method, whose value is a
CSDM object holding the dataset. The variable *processed_data* holds the output, that is,
the processed data as a CSDM object. The plot of the original and the processed data is
shown below.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> _, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 3), subplot_kw={"projection":"csdm"}) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[0].plot(csdm_object, color="black", linewidth=1) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[0].set_title('Before') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[1].plot(processed_data.real, color="black", linewidth=1) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[1].set_title('After') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.tight_layout() # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.show() # doctest: +SKIP

    The figure depicts an application of Gaussian convolution on a CSDM object.


Multiple convolutions
'''''''''''''''''''''

As mentioned before, a CSDM object may hold multiple dependent variables. When using the
list of the operations, you may selectively apply a given operation to a specific
dependent-variable by specifying the index of the corresponding dependent-variable as an
argument to the operation class. Consider the following list of operations.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> processor = sp.SignalProcessor(
    ...     operations=[
    ...         sp.IFFT(),
    ...         sp.apodization.Gaussian(FWHM='0.1 km', dv_index=0),
    ...         sp.apodization.Exponential(FWHM='50 m', dv_index=1),
    ...         sp.FFT(),
    ...     ]
    ... )

The above signal processing operations first applies an inverse Fourier transform,
followed by a Gaussian apodization on the dependent variable at index 0, followed
by an Exponential apodization on the dependent variable at index 1, and finally a
forward Fourier transform. Note, the FFT and IFFT operations apply on all
dependent-variables.

Let's add another dependent variable to the previously created CSDM object.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # Add a dependent variable to the test CSDM object.
    >>> test_data = np.zeros(500)
    >>> test_data[150] = 1
    >>> csdm_object.add_dependent_variable(cp.as_dependent_variable(test_data))

As before, apply the operations with the
:meth:`~mrsimulator.signal_processing.SignalProcessor.apply_operations` method.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> processed_data = processor.apply_operations(data=csdm_object)

The plot of the dataset before and after signal processing is shown below.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> _, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 3), subplot_kw={"projection":"csdm"}) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[0].plot(csdm_object, linewidth=1) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[0].set_title('Before') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[1].plot(processed_data.real, linewidth=1) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[1].set_title('After') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.tight_layout() # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.show() # doctest: +SKIP

.. _fig4_signal_process:

    CSDM object.


Convolution along multiple dimensions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In the case of multi-dimensional datasets, besides the dependent-variable index, you may
also specify a dimension index along which a particular operation will apply. For example,
consider the following 2D datasets as a CSDM object,

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> # Create a two-dimensional CSDM object.
    >>> test_data = np.zeros(600).reshape(30, 20)
    >>> test_data[15, 10] = 1
    >>> dv = cp.as_dependent_variable(test_data)
    >>> dim1 = cp.LinearDimension(count=20, increment='0.1 ms', coordinates_offset='-1 ms', label='t1')
    >>> dim2 = cp.LinearDimension(count=30, increment='1 cm/s', label='s1')
    >>> csdm_data = cp.CSDM(dependent_variables=[dv], dimensions=[dim1, dim2])

where ``csdm_data`` is a two-dimensional dataset. Now consider the following signal processing
operations

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> processor = sp.SignalProcessor(
    ...     operations=[
    ...         sp.IFFT(dim_index=(0, 1)),
    ...         sp.apodization.Gaussian(FWHM='0.5 ms', dim_index=0),
    ...         sp.apodization.Exponential(FWHM='10 cm/s', dim_index=1),
    ...         sp.FFT(dim_index=(0, 1)),
    ...     ]
    ... )
    >>> processed_data = processor.apply_operations(data=csdm_data)

The above set of operations first performs an inverse FFT on the dataset along the dimension
index 0 and 1. The second and third operations apply a Gaussian and Lorentzian apodization
along dimensions 0 and 1, respectively. The last operation is a forward Fourier transform.
The before and after plots of the datasets are shown below.

.. plot::
    :format: doctest
    :context: close-figs
    :include-source:

    >>> _, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 3), subplot_kw={"projection":"csdm"}) # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[0].imshow(csdm_data, aspect='auto') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[0].set_title('Before') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[1].imshow(processed_data.real, aspect='auto') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> ax[1].set_title('After') # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.tight_layout() # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> plt.show() # doctest: +SKIP

Serializing the operations list
-------------------------------

You may also serialize the operations list using the
:meth:`~mrsimulator.signal_processing.SignalProcessor.json`
method, as follows

.. doctest::

    >>> from pprint import pprint
    >>> pprint(processor.json())
    {'operations': [{'dim_index': [0, 1], 'function': 'IFFT'},
                    {'FWHM': '0.5 ms',
                     'dim_index': 0,
                     'function': 'apodization',
                     'type': 'Gaussian'},
                    {'FWHM': '10.0 cm / s',
                     'dim_index': 1,
                     'function': 'apodization',
                     'type': 'Exponential'},
                    {'dim_index': [0, 1], 'function': 'FFT'}]}
