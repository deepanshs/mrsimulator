`mrsimulator` is an open-source python package for fast computation/analysis of solid-state
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of both crystalline and amorphous materials. The core
of the `mrsimulator` library is written in C, wrapped, and made available in python.

> :warning: The package is currently under development. We advice using with caution. Bug report are greatly appreciated.

## Why use mrsimulator?

- It is open-source and free.
- It is a fast and versatile solid-state NMR simulator of one-dimensional static, MAS,
  and VAS spectra of nuclei experiencing chemical shift (nuclear shielding) and quadrupolar
  coupling interactions.
- It include simulations of weakly coupled nuclei experiencing J and dipolar couplings.
- It is fully documented with a stable and simple API and is easily incorporated into your
  python scripts and web apps.
- It is compatible with modern python packages, such as scikit-learn, Keras, etc.
- Packages using mrsimulator -

### Features

The `mrsimulator` package currently offers the following

- **Fast simulation** of one-dimensional solid-state NMR spectra. See our
  [benchmark results](https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/benchmark.html).

- Simulation of **coupled and uncoupled spin system**

  - for spin I=1/2, and quadrupole I>1/2 nuclei,
  - at arbitrary macroscopic magnetic flux density,
  - at arbitrary rotor angles, and
  - at arbitrary spinning frequency.

- A library of **NMR methods**,

  - 1D Bloch decay spectrum,
  - 1D Bloch decay central transition spectrum,
  - 2D Multi-Quantum Variable Angle Spinning (MQ-VAS),
  - 2D Satellite-transition Variable Angle Spinning (MQ-VAS),
  - 2D Dynamic Angle Spinning (DAS),
  - 2D isotropic/anisotropic sideband correlation spectrum (e.g. PASS and MAT), and
  - 2D Magic Angle Flipping (MAF).

- **Models** for tensor parameter distribution in amorphous materials.

[documentation](https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Installation

    $ pip install mrsimulator

Please read our [installation document](https://mrsimulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/users.html) for details.

## Check your build

If the installation is successful, you should be able to run the following
[test file](https://raw.github.com/DeepanshS/mrsimulator-examples/master/test_file_v0.3.py?raw=true)
in your terminal.

    $ python test_file.py

This should produce the following figure.
