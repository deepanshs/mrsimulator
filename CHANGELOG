v0.3.0
 - New Method object for simulation NMR spectrum. Two build-in methods---BlochDecaySpectrum
   and BlochDecayCentralTransitionSpectrum. The Bloch decay spectrum simulates all p=-1
   transition pathways, while central transition selective Bloch decay spectrum simulates
   all p=-1 and d=0 transition pathways.
 - Improved simulation performance.

v0.2.0
 - Added more isotopes to the simulator. Source NMR Tables (https://apps.apple.com/bn/app/nmr-tables/id1030899609?mt=12)
 - Added two new keywords: 'atomic_number' and 'quadrupole_moment'
 - Renamed the class Spectrum to Dimension
 - Added documentation for every class.
 - Added examples for simulating NMR quadrupolar lineshapes
 - Added amplitude normalization. The spectral amplitudes no longer change when
   integral_density, integral_volume, number of sidebands, or number of points
   along the dimension is changed.
 - Removed plotly-dash app to its own repository.

v0.1.3
    Fixed missing files from source tar.

v0.1.2
    Release on pypi.

v0.1.1
    - Added solid state quadrupolar lineshape simulation.
    - Added mrsimulator plotly-dash app.

v0.1.0
    - Solid state chemical shift anisotropy lineshape simulation
