v0.7.0
------

What's new
''''''''''

**General**

- Support for complex amplitude simulation.
- Add `isotropic_interpolation` as a `sim.config` parameter. The interpolation schemes are linear
  and Gaussian.

**Method**

- Removed ``Method1D`` and ``Method2D`` classes. Use the generic ``mrsimulator.method.Method``
  object for custom1D and 2D methods.
- New Event classes---``SpectralEvent`` and ``MixingEvent``. The MixingEvent
  controls the mixing of transitions in a multi-event method.
- A ``TransitionPathway`` object now includes a weight attribute, which holds the probability of
  the transition pathway based on the mixing events defined within the method.
- New class method, ``plot()``, which will create a visual representation of the events, transition
  pathways, rotor angle, etc. a method object defines.

**SpinSystem**

- Add a new function ``simplify()`` to the spin system object, which reduces a spin system to
  a list of irreducible spin systems.
- Add a new function ``site_generator()`` to the utility collection sub-module, which simplify
  the process of creating Site objects in bulk.
- Added gyromagnetic ratio and quadrupole moment data for all isotopes, including unstable
  isotopes.

**Documentation**

- Restructured documentation layout
- Added instillation troubleshooting section
- Added section *User Guide* detailing use and attributes of most objects.
- Condensed simulation/fitting gallery by removing redundant examples
- New gallery demonstrating signal processing functions.

Changes
'''''''

- `reduced_dict` function is deprecated, use `json(units=False)` instead.


Bug fixes

v0.6.0
------

What's new

- ⭐ Improved simulation performance. ⭐ See our :ref:`benchmark`.
- Simulation of one-dimensional spectra of coupled spin systems. The frequency contributions
  from the coupled sites include weak J-couplings and weak dipolar couplings.

- Added a new ``Sites`` class that holds a list of Site objects. The Sites class method,
  ``to_pd()``, exports the sites as a pandas data frame.

  unique ``Sites`` objects within the Simulator object across multiple spin systems.
- Added three new arguments to the ``single_site_system_generator()`` method,
  'site_labels', 'site_names', and 'site_descriptions'.

Changes
'''''''

- The :meth:`~mrsimulator.SpinSystem.get_isotopes` method from the SpinSystem object,
  will now return :class:`~mrsimulator.spin_system.isotope.Isotope` objects by default.
  Use the `symbol=True` argument of the method to get a list of string isotopes.
- The ``to_freq_dict()`` function is deprecated.
- The `D` symmetry of `transition_query` attribute from `Method2D` method is now None by default.
- `BlochDecayCTSpectrum` is an alias for `BlochDecayCentralTransitionSpectrum` class.

Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Fixed a bug related to `get_spectral_dimensions()` utility method in cases when CSDM
  dimension objects have negative increment.
- Fixed a bug resulting in the non-conserved spectral area after a Gaussian apodization.

v0.5.1
------

Bug fixes
'''''''''

- Fixed a bug that was causing incorrect spectral binning when the frequency
  contribution is pure isotropic.

Other changes
'''''''''''''

- The ``to_dict_with_units()`` method is deprecated and is replaced with ``json()``
- The ``json()`` function returns a python dictionary object with minimal required keywords,
  where the event keys are globally serialized at the root method object. In the case where
  the event key value is different from the global value, the respective key is serialized
  within the event object.
- The ``json()`` function will no longer serialize the `transition_query` objects for the
  named objects.

v0.5.0
------

- Introduces a generic two-dimensional method, :class:`~mrsimulator.method.lib.Method2D`.
- Specialized two-dimensional methods for multi-quantum variable-angle spinning
  with build-in affine transformations.

  - ``BlochDecaySpectrum`` and

  Bloch decay central transition selective spectrum method simulates all transition
  pathways with p=Δm=-1 and d=0.

  dimensions information from the CSDM object.

'''''''''

- Fixed bug resulting from the rotation of the fourth rank tensor with non-zero euler
  angles.

  tensors are given.

  present.

Other changes
'''''''''''''

- Renamed  the ``decompose`` attribute from the ``ConfigSimulator`` class to
  ``decompose_spectrum``. The attribute is an enumeration with the following literals:

    spin systems.
  - ``spin_system``: Computes a series of spectra each corresponding to a single
    spin system.

- Renamed ``Isotopomer`` class to ``SpinSystem``.
- Renamed ``isotopomers`` attribute from ``Simulator`` class to ``spin_systems``.
