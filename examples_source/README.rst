In this section, we use the ``mrsimulator`` tools to create spin systems and
simulate spectrum with practical/experimental applications. These examples illustrate

- building spin systems (uncoupled and weakly-coupled),
- building NMR methods,
- simulating spectrum, and
- processing spectrum (e.g. adding line-broadening).

For applications related to least-squares fitting, see the
:ref:`fitting_examples`.
