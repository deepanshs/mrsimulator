1D NMR simulation (crystalline solids)
--------------------------------------

The following examples are the NMR spectrum simulation of crystalline solids for the
following methods:

- Bloch decay method (:class:`~mrsimulator.methods.BlochDecaySpectrum`),
- Central transition selective Bloch decay method (:class:`~mrsimulator.methods.BlochDecayCTSpectrum`).
- Generic one-dimensional method (:class:`~mrsimulator.methods.Method1D`).
