# **Create a custom method**
#
# Writing a custom method is simply specifying an appropriate list of event objects per
# spectral dimension. In this example, we are interested in a one-dimensional Hahnecho
# method, and we use the generic `Method1D` class as a template. For a Hahnecho, we will
# use two types of Event objects---SpectralEvent and MixingEvent.
#
# A SpectralEvent object is where we sample the frequency contributions. The net
# frequency along a given spectral dimension is a weighted average of the frequencies
# from all SpectralEvent objects within a given SpectralDimension, i.e.,
#
# .. math::
#       f = \sum_j w_j \times \nu_j,
#
# where :math:`f` is the net averaged frequency along a spectral dimension, :math:`w_j`
# is the weight (the attribute ``fraction``), and :math:`\nu_j` is the frequency from
# the :math:`j^\text{th}` SpectralEvent. The index :math:`j` runs over all spectral
# events within a spectral dimension.
#
# In the case of a one-dimensional Hahnecho method, the frequency is equally averaged
# over two spectral events, corresponding to the symmetry pathway,
#
# .. math::
#       p = 1 \rightarrow -1.
#
# In the following code, we define the two SpectralEvent objects with fraction 0.5 and
# the transition_query on channel-1 of P=[1] and P=[-1], respectively. Notice, the value
# for the ``P`` attribute is a list. Here, it is a list with a single integer. The list
# notation, ``[1]``, implies that the query selects all transitions where exactly one
# spin is undergoing a :math:`p=+1` transition with the remaining spin at :math:`p=0`.
# A similar argument holds for ``[-1]`` query. By implementing query objects, we
# decouple the method from the spin system, i.e., once a method is defined, it can be
# used to simulate spectra from any given spin system. We will demonstrate this
# momentarily by simulating a Hahnecho spectrum from single and two-site spin systems.
#
# Besides the SpectralEvent, you may also notice a MixingEvent sandwitched in-between
# the two SpectralEvent. A MixingEvent does not directly contribute to the frequencies.
# As the name suggests, a mixing event is used for the mixing of transitions in a
# multi-event method such as HahnEcho. In the following code, we define a mixing query
# on channel-1 by setting the attributes ``tip_angle`` and ``phase`` to :math:`\pi` and
# 0, respectively. There two parameters are analogous to the pulse angle and phase.
hahn_echo = Method1D(
    channels=["1H"],
    magnetic_flux_density=9.4,  # in T
    spectral_dimensions=[
        SpectralDimension(
            count=512,
            spectral_width=2e4,  # in Hz
            events=[
                SpectralEvent(fraction=0.5, transition_query=[{"ch1": {"P": [1]}}]),
                MixingEvent(mixing_query={"ch1": {"tip_angle": np.pi, "phase": 0}}),
                SpectralEvent(fraction=0.5, transition_query=[{"ch1": {"P": [-1]}}]),
            ],
        )
    ],
)

# You may also visualize the method using the `plot` function.
hahn_echo.plot()

# %%
# As mentioned before, a method object is decoupled from the spin system object. Notice,
# when we get the transition pathways from this method for a single-site spin system, we
# get a single transition pathway.
print(hahn_echo.get_transition_pathways(spin_system_1))

# %%
# The simulation from each spin system is stored as a dependent variable within the
# CSDM object. Use the `split` function to split the list of the dependent variables
# into a list of CSDM objects.

# Notice, in the single-site spin system, the hahn echo refocuses the isotropic chemical
# shits and chemical shift anisotropies. The end result is a resonance at zero
# frequency. In the case of the two homonuclear spin 1/2 coupled spin system, the Hahn
# echo refocuses the isotropic chemical shits and chemical shift anisotropies, but not
# the dipolar and `J` couplings.
