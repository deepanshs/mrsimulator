1D NMR simulation (macromolecules/amorphous solids)
---------------------------------------------------

The following examples are the NMR spectrum simulation of macromolecules and amorphous
materials for the following methods:

- Bloch decay method (:class:`~mrsimulator.methods.BlochDecaySpectrum`),
- Central transition selective Bloch decay method (:class:`~mrsimulator.methods.BlochDecayCTSpectrum`).

For NMR simulation of amorphous solids, we also show examples of simulating spectrum
using user-deined model or using commonly accepted models such as Czjzek or extended
Czjzek distribution.
