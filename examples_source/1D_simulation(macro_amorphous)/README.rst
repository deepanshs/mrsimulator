1D NMR simulation (macromolecules/amorphous solids)
---------------------------------------------------

The following examples are the NMR spectrum simulation of macromolecules and amorphous
materials for the following methods:

- Bloch decay method (:py:class:`~mrsimulator.method.lib.BlochDecaySpectrum`),
- Central transition selective Bloch decay method (:py:class:`~mrsimulator.method.lib.BlochDecayCTSpectrum`).

For NMR simulation of amorphous solids, we also show examples of simulating spectrum
using user-defined model or using commonly accepted models such as Czjzek or extended
Czjzek distribution.
