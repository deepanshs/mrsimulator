 * @struct MRS_plan
 * A mrsimulator plan for computing spectra. The plan, MRS_plan includes,
 *    - a pre-calculated MRS_averaging_scheme,
 *    - pre-calculates stacked arrays of irreducible second-rank, wigner-2j(β), and
 *      fourth-rank, wigner-4j(β), matrices at every orientation angle β,
 *    - pre-calculates the exponent of the sideband order phase, @f$\exp(-im\alpha)@f$,
 *      at every orientation angle α,
 *    - create the fftw plan, and
 *    - allocating buffer for storing the evaluated frequencies and their respective
 *      amplitudes.
 *
 * Creating a plan adds an overhead to the simulation. Recommendation is to create the
 * plan at the start and re-using it as necessary. This is especially efficient when
 * performing a batch simulation, such as, simulating spectra from thousands of spin
 * systems.
